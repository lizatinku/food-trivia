## 🌟 Inspiration
Indian food is my favorite cuisine — rich, diverse, and full of stories. I grew up with these flavors, and this app is my way of sharing that love with others in a fun and interactive way. Whether you're a lifelong foodie or just curious, I hope this trivia brings you joy

- 🎨 Clean, responsive UI optimized for trivia interactions
- 🔥 Neon-style buttons for that extra masala
- 🔐 User Authentication (Email/password + Google) – powered by Supabase (in progress)
